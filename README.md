# Image Captioning in English and Urdu

This project, titled "Caption-Generation", implements an image captioning system using deep learning, capable of generating captions for images in both English and Urdu languages. The model architecture combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Bahdanau Attention for generating captions.

## Project Structure

- `Caption_Generation_English.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the English caption generation model.
- `Caption_Generation_Urdu.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the Urdu caption generation model.
- `data.txt`: File containing the links of both English and Urdu datasets.
